# simpleFFT

simpleFFT is supposed to be the cleanest, most readable, O(n log n)
implementation of the Fast Fourier transform. It isn't optimized for memory or
processing power, but rather elegance and ease of understanding.

## What book?

### A First Course in Fourier Analysis by David W. Kammler

Chapter 5 covers all the operator notation and their Fourier transforms.

Chapter 6 covers the Fast Fourier Transform, which is where almost all the
principles for the program come from.
